             <p>Hi! My name is Jo√£o Victor and I recently made the decision to work with web development.</p>
             <p>I have a degree in Civil Engineering but working with graphic design and programming has always been an important part of my life.</p>
             <p>For that reason, I've decided to follow my dream and become the best developer I can be, and this is just the first step. This website and all the other
             projects displayed bellow have really helped cement my knowledge.</p>
             <p>That's why I think it's time to start working!</p>

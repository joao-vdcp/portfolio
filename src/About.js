             <p>Hi! My name is Jo√£o Victor and I recently made the decision to work with web development.</p>
             <p>I have a degree in Civil Engineering but working with graphic design and programming has always been an important part of my life.</p>
             <p>I'm a developer, designer and linguist who has been building for the web in some capacity since 2001. 
             I specialise in <b>accessibility</b>, performance and usability without sacrificing creativity.</p>
